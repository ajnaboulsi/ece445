- Final Presentation Day
- Edit Final Paper

Today, we had our final presentation with Nikhil (our TA) and Professor Mironenko along with some students and other TAs. I believe it went decently well! We covered all the information that we wanted to although we went a bit over time and also didn't get to show the 1 minute demo video for the sake of time; however, all in all I think the audience enjoyed it. There were also some good questions that were asked and I enjoyed the experience too.

We also spent a couple hours reading through our Final Paper and reviewing/editing the information as needed.
