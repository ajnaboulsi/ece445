- Prepare for Mock Demo

Today, we met up as a team to prepare the presentation slides for our mock demo and eventually real demo. I spent most of the time working on the design, results, ethics, and conlcusion slides. Other than reusing and refining our documentation from our design doc and lab notebooks, we spent some time thinking about future improvements that could be implemented regarding the project. To name a few:

1. Firstly, of course, moving our design onto a working PCB​

2. Using a Lidar sensor as opposed to an Ultrasonic​
​
3. Using a better voltage supply such as a wall plug in​
​
4. Better motors for more control of shuffling, dealing, and rotation​
​
5. Adding an arm lever or a weight so that the cards have enough downward pressure to be shuffled out​


We also came up with some additional features:

1. Card Game – Gaming Console​
Store all common game modes on the card gaming console and allow users to buy the premium pre-programmed game modes​
​
2. Dealer Tracking​
The system will rotate the position of the dealer before dispensing cards to the left (counterclockwise direction) of the dealer​
​
3. Customize Game Modes directly onto the device​
Have an option to customize and save a game mode onto the ACD solely using the buttons on the device (no programming required)

Lastly, rohit and I filmed a short video for the extra credit assignment showing an example of why we would use the shuffler/dealer and how it works.
