- Signup for demo and presentation
- Solder on the rest of the components to our pcb

Today, we signed up for our demo (4/25/2023 at 5PM) and presentation (5/1/2023 5PM). Afterwards, we went to ECEB to work on soldering the components and testing their continuities as we went along. We spent quite a bit of time solering on all the components. When we got the resistors and capacitors, we thought we had ordered the right sizes according to the footprints we had on our pcb. But despite trying to desolder and resolder the components, we were unable to get the capacitors and resistors properly soldered on (when testing for continuity we were getting nothing). Since placing an order for new capacitors and resistors would take too long at this point in time (as it would come right before our demo), we ended up deciding to try getting everything working on the breadboard and using the stm32 nucleo dev board in the meantime. Although we finished soldering on all the components we were unfortunately unable to use the pcb.
