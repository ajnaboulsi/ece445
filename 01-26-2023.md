- Work on CAD Assingnment

Today, we individually worked on our CAD assignments. For the assignment, our goals was to design a PCB for the mini encabulator and eventually write code that allows the user to make the LED blink at a rate proportional to a potentiometer position when pressing down on a button (and making adjustments to the potentiometer resistance).

We made the schematic on kicad and followed the tutorial on the ECE 445 course website.
