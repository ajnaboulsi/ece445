# Objectives
- Mock Demo
- Team contract fulfillment

Today, we had our mock demo, which went well. Nikhil gave us some tips in preparation for the actual demo. We still have some work to do in terms of touching up the functionality, but we are confident we will have everything working by the time of the final demo.

After our meeting, we worked on the team contract fulfillment document discussing project goals, expectations, roles, our agenda, and any team issues we encountered.
