DESIGN CHANGE: We also changed our originally planned servo dealing motor to a dc motor because after some research we found that a dc motor would be more suitable as it would rotate faster and shoot out cards (we also didn't need position control which servo's usually provide). This also meant we needed another motor driver since our single L293D motor driver can only support the two shuffling dc motors. With direction control we could push out a card and reverse the direction quickly with the motor driver to ensure just one card is shot out of the slit in our design. We added a motor driver to our schematic with the required connections to the microcontroller (pwm control signal). We also thus ordered a dc motor through amazon such that it could arrive quickly.
