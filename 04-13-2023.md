- Integrate each other's code and make stm program with pins corresponding to our chip

Today, we met up as a team to work on some code since our pcb has not arrived yet. We spent some time looking at each other's code and understanding how everything would work together. We then made a new STM32 program on the ide using the STM32F103C8T6 as the main chip instead of the nucleo dev board that we were using for testing. It took some time to adjust the pinout and make sure each of the pins on the microcontroller were set to the right setting (GPIO_OUT/IN, TIMER CHANNELS, etc.)
