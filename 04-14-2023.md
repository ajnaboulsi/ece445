- Pickup new stencil and pcb 
- Solder on the microcontroller chip

Today, we met up at ECEB to pickup the parts that shipped in along with our new pcb and stencil. We went to the senior design lab and spent some time watching videos on soldering to ensure we don't mess up while soldering on our microcontroller chip. We first did some practice runs using other components and old pcbs. Once we were comfortable with that, we attempted to solder on the microcontroller chip. On the last set of pins, when trying to remove solder, we ended up bending a couple of the pins. 

We went to the open lab afterwards to have some more space and use a better iron. When we found a spot we used our second microcontroller chip and soldered it onto another board. This time, we were succesful.
