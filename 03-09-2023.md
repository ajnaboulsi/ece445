- Final revisions with machine shop (assigned Dave)

Today, we went over to the machine shop and brought over the standalone card shuffler that we got through amazon along with the dc motor we had ordered. We were assigned Dave by Greg, so we met up with Dave for a short period; he asked us a couple questions that we had answers for, and he said he was good to go. He suspected he would finish making the whole design by the end of spring break.
