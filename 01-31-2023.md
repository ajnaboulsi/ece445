- Met and worked on the RFA

Today, our goal was to write up an RFA for our Card Dealer and Shuffler Idea and submit it. We went over the assignment details on the course website and created a shared google doc. We simply followed the outline and wrote each section consecutively (Problem, Solution, Solution Components, and Criterion for Success). We used our project proposal as the foundation and built upon it. When it came to the Solution Components portion, we discussed how to modularize the project and came to the conclusion that there would be 3 main components (shuffler, dealer/distributor, and user interface). 

We also came up with possible components for each section: 

Here is a list of possible components that are necessary for this subsystem.
    2x servo motors - responsible for 
    2x contact sensors
    card holder
    microcontroller

Here is a list of possible components that are necessary for this subsystem
    1x stepper motor - rotate the deck and stop at preset angular positions
    1x servo motor - ‘throw’ a single card towards a player
    2x contact sensors
    card holder
    microcontroller

Here is a list of possible components that are necessary for this subsystem
    4 buttons
    Debouncer

Lastly for the criterion for success portion we devised 3 main high level goals:

1. Shuffle a set of cards evenly
    This can be tested by looking at the cards before and after the card shuffler is done in order to determine the effectiveness of the shuffle. 

2. Distribute the cards to the players
    This can be tested visually by checking that the cards that are on the board have been distributed correctly and in the right order.

3. Buttons for user interface
    Test each of the buttons to make sure they are performing as expected.
