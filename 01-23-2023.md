- Laboratory Safety Training
- Trying for Early Project Approval

Today we met up as a team to try and brainstorm some new ideas and aim for early project approval. We also all agreed to finishing our laboratory safety training after the meeting. In regards to brainstorming, we had trouble thinking of feasible, interesting, new ideas. So we took a look at our ideas from our first meeting and their respective posts to find that the leaf raker and robotic wall painter projects were not approved. The autonomous card dealer project however was approved and we all were interested in it, so we took a final vote and decided to take on that project.

Since the early project approval deadline was coming up, we worked on the RFA together and finalized our post, then uploaded it to PACE.

After the meeting, I checked the laboratory safety training course and found that I already took it 2 years ago but needed a refresher, so I skimmed through the training content for a reminder and submitted the certificate.
