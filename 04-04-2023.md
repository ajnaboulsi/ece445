- Testing PCB circuitry (voltage regulators) using STM Nucleo Dev Board

Today, I did some testing for our voltage regulators. First I started testing the outputs of our voltage regulators when a 9V lithium ion battery is used as an input. Using a breadboard and any resistors/resistors we had available, and following our schematic power subsystem layout, I made the circuity for our 6V step down first. Instead of a 910ohm resistor I used 3 resistors in series to get 880ohms. With a multimeter, I probed the output and got ~6.14V. Then I connected the next voltage regulator with the 6.14V as an input and used resistors in series to get 760ohm (instead of 680ohms). Again, I probed the output and saw ~5.47V. Then I connected the next voltage regulator with the 5.47V as an input and used resistors in series to get 430ohms (instead of 390ohms). Again, I probed the output and saw ~3.43V. These values were sufficient to theoretically power every component on the pcb we needed.
