- Get the compnents working together with breadboarding and the stm32 nucleo dev board

Today, we met up as a team and actually decided to go attempt to resolder some of the components on the pcb before switching over to breadboarding and retesting for continuity but unfortunately we still were not able to get it working. Now with reverting back to breadboarding and using the nucleo dev board, we made a new program on the stm32ide setting up the pinout once more. While making adjustments to the code and uploading it to the dev board, for some reason we suddenly started getting an error which wasn't allowing us to program it. We spent a couple hours trying to fix it but the chip on the board kept running hot. Luckily, we had another dev board handy that we could use.
