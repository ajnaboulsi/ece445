# Objectives
- Met with TA for first time
- Complete Soldering Assignment 

Today, we had our first meeting with our Teaching Assistant, Nikhil, in ECEB 3081. First, Nikhil went over some logistics and we picked a time to meet on a weekly basis (Wednesday at 1PM). We then discussed our project idea and he helped us refine some details regarding the project, particularly how we were splitting up the subsystems and the different componenets we may need.

After the team meeting, we went to the senior design lab to work on and finish the soldering assignment which was basically a continuation of the mini encabulator schematic assignment. We spent a couple hours working on solderin the pcb components, and then tested the continuity of each component. Next, we programmed the encabulator using the code on the 445 website (with some adjustments) through the arduino ide. Once we got the led blinking at a frequency proportional to the potentiometer value, we demonstrated it to the TA.
