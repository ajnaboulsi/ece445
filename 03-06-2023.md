# Objectives
- Finish PCB and check if it passes audit
- Finish Team Evaluation

Today, we worked on the pcb a little bit more, primarily we just put it through the ERC checker and found a bunch of minor errors. We had to simply move around some of the wires since they were too close to one another. Once we finished with the adjustments and the ERC checker passed without any errors, we looked into the gerber file generation, followed the instructions for placing a pcb order, and sent an email to our TA (Nikhil) with the gerber files attached such that he could place the order for us.

Afterwards, we worked on the team evalution forms on canvas separately and submitted our feedback.
