- Picked up parts 
- Fixed Schematic and PCB

Today, we picked up a bunch of the parts and our pcb boards that we ordered from ECEB. When comparing the sizes of our capacitors and resistors to the footprints on our board, however, we realized they were too small. We also decided to order some extra parts for testing purposes (voltage regulators, batteries, another microcontroller chip). Later, we reviewed our schematic and realized that two of the voltage buses goin to the VCC1/2 pins on the motor drivers were the wrong buses (5V instead of 6V and vice versa). So we made those adjustments and edited the pcb as well to prepare for the next order.
