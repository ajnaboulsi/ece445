- Mock Presentation

Today, we had our mock presentation. We got some good feedback from the TAs and the students. The following points were brought up regarding our presentation:

1. Reduce text on the presentation slides
2. Keep good posture, no fidgeting or swaying
3. Bring the actual card dealer/shuffler when presenting to explain stuff as a we go
4. Split the slides evenly among the team
5. Add some more pictures
