- Finish Integrating everything onto the breadboard layout

Today, we met up as a team and began integrating all the code onto one project file and organizing the code such that a user can interface with the buttons and display to shuffle, deal, select the number of players and game mode, etc. We also worked with the ultrasonic sensor code. We tried to get the code working such that whenever the ultrasonic distance reading would dip below a threshold value (30cm or so), the device would deal a card. We got it working, however, the ultrasonic readings kept deviating and were not consistent. After some debugging, we found out that the ultrasonic we were using was not very good. We switched it out for another ultrasonic sensor and the readings came out much more consistent and accurate. At this point, all we have left before the demo is touching up some of the funcitonality, integrating the game modes, attaching all the breadboards onto the shuffler, and refiing the dealing slit to ensure only one card would come out at a time.
