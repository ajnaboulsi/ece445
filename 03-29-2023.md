- Finished Individual Progress Report
- Submitted next round of PCB

Today, I finished up my Individual Progress Report; I worked on the ethics part, self-assessment portion, and conlcusion and reviewed the rest of the document (and sighted my sources). In regards to the ethics part, I consulted the IEEE code of ethics and the ACM code of ethics for most of the concerns. 

After submitting my Progress report, we again compiled the pcb into gerber files and drill files to get our stencil and sent the request for a pcb over to Nikhil (our TA).
