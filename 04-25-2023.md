- Demo

Today, we had our demo! We prepared slightly beforehand and made sure everything was working properly. We used a new set of batteries as well. During the actual demo, the right motor was dying off at some points, which may be because the battery drained while we were preparing, but regardless, it went well! Professor Mironenko seemed to enjoy the presentation and was intruiged!
