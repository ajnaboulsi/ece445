# Objectives
- Worked on PCB
- Prepared for Design Review

Today we continued working on our pcb, adding the rest of the connections, considering which connections should use thicker wires and such (high power and current components).

After finishing up our pcb design for the day, we began preparing for the design review. We looked over the sequence of topics that would be discussed, and practiced presenting each part using our completed design document as a reference.
