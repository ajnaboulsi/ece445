- Work on the code and integrating everything on breadboard

Today, with going back to the breadboard, we rewired the power subsystem with the 13V, 6V, 5V, and 3.3V regulators and retested the outputs with the 2 9V batteries in series as the input. Afterwards, I wrote some code on the stm32ide to try and get a small diy servo we had running properly before using the one on the card shuffler. After reading up some documentation on setting up the timer channels for servo motor control and connecting the right pins from the servo to the dev board, I was able to get the code working where the diy servo would rotate to roughly any angle between 0 and 180 degrees.
