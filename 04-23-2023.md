# Objectives
- Touching up the funcitnality and refining dealing slit
- Preparing for demo 

Today, we began by attaching the breadboards and the stm32 nucelo dev board onto the card shuffler/dealer as follows:

Afterwards, we programmed in the game modes and adjusting the servo motor code such that it would rotate the proper amount according to the number of players. We did some full testing run throughs of the code to ensure everyhting was functioning properly. We some refinements we were no longer running into any problems. Now, all we had left was refining the size of the dealing slit. Using a slip of paper and adjusting the slit size by sliding the paper up and down, we were able to get 1 card to deal 90% of the time with an occasional 2 cards or no cards coming out. If we were using the pcb and didn't have to mount of the breadboard, we would have used the component that the mechanical team gave us to allow only one card to deal, but this was not an option. Regardless, we got everything working properly and consistently.
