# Objectives
- Meet with TA
- Fix Project proposal for proposal review
- Begin working on design document
- Work on schematic alongside and thinking about parts

Today, we had our weekly TA meeting and we discussed the project proposal points we were taken off (reasoning being tolerance analysis and ethics/safety). We asked for some elaboration on what we did wrong and what changes needed to be made. We also asked about the design doc written requirements. Regarding the project proposal changes that had to be done, our tolerance analysis was simply incomplete, and for ethics/safety we didnt address enough ethical concerns. When revising our proposal, we came up with the following tolerance analysis risks (along with possible solutions and tests):

- False measurements from the ultrasonic sensor
- Friction from the device platform
- Air resistance while cards are traveling through the air
- The dealing motor not having enough torque/power to distribute the cards a long distance
- The slit not being the correct length to which it will only allow a single card through

For our ethics revisions, we consulted the IEEE Code of Ethics and addressed some of its points.

Next, we transfered over and reworked the information on our project proposal to the design document (intro, design, ethics/safety).

I also put a good amount of work into making a schematic through kicad with the various subsystems and components they each contatin that we decided upon earlier. I reference old designs on the website with mechanical components along with various youtube videos and information online to put everything together â€“ with some deesign decisions being made as a group. 

As a side note, we also looked more into 3d printing and started coming to the conlcusion that it wasn't very feasible. So we decided to meet up with the mechanical team again and try coming up with a solution.
