# Objectives
- Began ordering parts
- Worked on PCB based on input from professors

Firstly, we had our design review recently and we got a lot of criticism regarding our requirements and verification, particularly that they were too general and not specific to our project, so we made note of that.

Today, we started to order different parts that we needed for our project (hex display, voltage regulators, resistors, capacitors ultrasonic, microcontroller, batteries). We also had our pcb review recently and got some feedback from Professor Gruev. He said it looked good other than refining the size of our wires and making sure thicker wires were used for high power and current consuming components. And another small thing was reorganizing the placement of some of the components to spread out everything and maximize the use of the board. He also reminded us to do a ERC check and make sure it's good to go. 

Later, we touched up the pcb chaning some of the wire thicknesses and adjusting the placement of some components.
