- Editing Presentation 
- Preparing for final presentation
- Working on final paper

Today, we worked on editing our presentation to factor in the points brought up during our mock demo (partiuarly the fact that there was too much text on some of the slides). After reducing the text and making the information more concise, we labeled each slide by who was going to be presenting it and then did some practice runs for the presentation.

After feeling comfortable with our presentation preparation, we decided to work on the final paper. We spent quite a bit of time organizing the sections within the final paper and drawing from old documentation to rewrite the design and verification sections. We made sure to include useful images along with our verification tables for reference and testing results in the appendix. We discussed our old design and the changes we made and described each subsystem in depth. We also went through our orders to update our cost analysis and reflected on our findings throughout the semester when writing up the conclusion, future work, and ethical considerations sections. We plan on editing the writing style and reviewing all of the information after our final presentation tomorrow.
