# Objectives
- Continue working on the design document
- Finished up the Team Contract

Today we met up as a team to add final touches to the design document. We reviewed the tolerace analysis section since we had originally lost points on that in the project proposal (added more detail to the risks and solutions/tests). We also reviewed and refined the schedule Ralph worked on prior.

After finishing up the design doc, we worked on and finished the team contract.

We discussed our project goals, expectations (ground rules), and our roles. Regarding ground rules, we brought up topics such as, Communication, Participation, Accountability, Documentation, Testing, Feedback, and Respect.
